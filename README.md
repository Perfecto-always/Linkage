# What we are?
We are just a small team of very engaging people very enthusiastic. For us work is not just work but its passion, hobby and worship.

## What is in the client folder?
It's very self explanatory. It's a front-end for our application/website/web-app.

## What is in the server folder?
It has the backend system for authentication and user management data-base key

#### But we don't have keys/.env?
Here is the example of how it will look
```
DB_CONNECTION = "Your DATABASE MANAGEMENT KEY" //Do not that this must be a string
TOKEN_SECRET = "This is not to be disclosed"
```
